# Motion-Detection-Recorder-Template
This repository contains a template for a motion detection recorder that automatically detects movement while recording and deletes idle frames. It provides a simple and efficient solution for capturing video footage while filtering out periods of inactivity. 

Features:

 * Motion detection: The recorder utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect movement in the video frames.
 * Automatic deletion: When the user is idle, the recorder automatically identifies and removes the frames with no motion.
